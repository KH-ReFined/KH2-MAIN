### Kingdom Hearts II:

- **ModuleRF-ShortcutSets** has been ported over to the new module framework.
    - Hopefully fixed all remaining bugs with Ultrawide compliance.
    
- Fix the config menu crashing on certain worlds while Encounter Plus is equipped.

- When in a form, "Obtained Munny!" prompt will be replaced by "Next Form Level" prompt, showing you how much EXP you need to farm to level up your current Drive Form.
